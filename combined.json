It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed in in   the construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry for the assembling of heavy equipment.  loading   and   unloading   of   freight,  the transport industry   for    the       Project Title: FLY WHEEL               Description:  A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently store rotational   energy.   Flywheels   resist   changes   in   rotational   speed   by   their moment   of inertia.   The   amount   of   energy   stored   in   a   flywheel   is   proportional   to   the   square   of its rotational   speed.   The   way   to   change   a   flywheel   stored   energy   is   by   increasing   or decreasing its rotational speed applying a torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.  f0d8 ACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES / EXTRA CURRICULAR  ACTIVITIES:  f0d8 Auto CAD And Pro/E Certificate.  f0d8 Bharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.

Present  design  analyzed  on  JMAG/ANSYS  Maxwell  to  find  out  their  limitations,  Based  on  that  find  out  simulation  results  &  new  concepts  for  contact  system  of the MCCB  is  generate.  Project  objective  is  to  enhance  repulsion  threshold  current  (Irp)  of  contact  system  of  250  A  frame  MCCB.  Electromagnetic  repulsion  forces  generated  between  moving  &  fixed  contacts  are  of  repulsive  nature  due  to  opposite  direction  of  current  path.  The  mechanical force offered by MCCB mechanism opposes these Electromagnetic repulsion forces. In this  project contact pressure (CP) offered by contact springs will be a constant.   f0b7  Duration: 1 year (July 2014-April 2015)      f076  Project Title : Generator Protection & Testing of Relays.  f076  Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station, Gandhinagar.   f0b7  Objective  :  The  objective  of  this  project  is  to  understand  all  about  generator  protection  schemes  &  their settings, testing of some protection relay using micro-controller. To protect the generator against  the  over  current,  differential  and  turbine  to  boiler  trip  with  help  of  instantaneous  micro-controller  based  relay,  one  can  practically  implement  this  program.  Programming  is  done  in  Code  Vision  AVR  software  and  simulated  in  Proteus  software.  Result  of  this  simulation  is  implemented  in  hardware.  Hardware results are same as software result. These programs can be used as reference in power plant  industries.   f0b7  Duration: 1 year.

Team size  : 3  Objectives  : Protection of Motor using Static CTMM Relays.  Description : In Early days the manual testing takes lot of time and shows inaccurate  results under certain conditions and also with limited specifications and tolerance levels  for testing of relays, these drawbacks can be overcome by using computerized testing  with EPOCH equipment.                5 of 6                  Now a days high rating motors can be protected by using newly introduced  CTMM relay. Our main aim in this project is to protect different kinds of motor by using  CTMM static relay with EPOCH.  Languages known  English, Tamil.

Pelton turbines (wheel) are suitable for power extraction, when the water energy is  available at high head and low flow rate. Pelton turbine is most efficient at this  condition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high  pressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even  when the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in all sizes.  INDUSTRIAL TRAINING  1.
