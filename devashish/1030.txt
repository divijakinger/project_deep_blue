Hydraulic Turbine Based on Pelton Wheel:-
Pelton turbine (wheel) is use to convert hydraulic energy in to mechanical energy
followed by electrical       energy.
Pelton turbines (wheel) are suitable for power extraction, when the water energy is 
available at high head and low flow rate. Pelton turbine is most efficient at this 
condition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high 
pressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even 
when the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in
all sizes.
