It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other\r\nplaces. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and\r\nthus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed\r\nin\r\nin  \r\nthe construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry\r\nfor the assembling of heavy equipment.\r\n\r\nloading   and   unloading   of   freight,\r\n\r\nthe transport industry   for  \r\n\r\nthe  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProject Title: FLY WHEEL\r\n\r\n             Description:  A flywheel is a mechanical device specifically designed to efficiently\r\nstore rotational   energy.   Flywheels   resist   changes   in   rotational   speed   by   their moment   of\r\ninertia.   The   amount   of   energy   stored   in   a   flywheel   is   proportional   to   the   square   of\r\nits rotational   speed.   The   way   to   change   a   flywheel   stored   energy   is   by   increasing   or\r\ndecreasing its rotational speed applying a torque aligned with its axis of symmetry.\r\n\r\n ACHIEVEMENTS / CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES / EXTRA CURRICULAR\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\n Auto CAD And Pro/E Certificate.\r\n\r\n Bharat Vikash Parishad Certificate.\r\n\r\nINPLANT TRAINING / INDUSTRIAL VISIT:\r\n\r\nANIL SPECIAL STEEL INDUSTRIES LTD JAIPUR               1 JUNE 2013 TO 30 JUNE 2013\r\n\r\n\fPERSONAL PROFILE:\r\n\r\nFather’s Name\r\n\r\n:Ram Chandra Bairwa\r\n\r\nDate of Birth             \r\n\r\n: 05th April 1990\r\n\r\nGender                    \r\n\r\n: Male \r\n\r\nPassport Number\r\n\r\n: M4017503\r\n\r\nLanguage Known      \r\n\r\n: English And Hindi\r\n\r\n Hobbies                     \r\n\r\n:   Singing   Songs,Listening   Music,Reading   Books,Social\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nServices.\r\n\r\nAddress                    \r\n\r\n:\r\n\r\n  186,Anantwada   Ka   Gola,\r\n\r\n  Bairwa   Ki\r\n\r\n  Dhani,Post-\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnantwada,Via-Bandikui,Tehsil-Baswa,District-\r\n\r\nDausa,Rajasthan,India-303313.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION:\r\n\r\nI hereby declare that the above particulars furnished by me are true to the best of my knowledge\r\nand belief. \r\n\r\nDate:25th July 2017\r\n\r\nPlace: Jaipur \r\n\r\n                           Bhagwan Sahay Bairwa\r\n\r\n\f",{"entities":[[0,20,"PERSON"],[31,55,"EMAIL"],[67,92,"CONTACT"],[389,444,"EDUCATION"],[446,476,"INSTITUTION"],[501,532,"EDUCATION"],[534,579,"INSTITUTION"],[607,628,"EDUCATION"],[630,675,"INSTITUTION"],[742,803,"EDUCATION"],[823,863,"INSTITUTION"],[1064,1239,"SKILLS"],[1245,1547,"SKILLS"],[1553,1741,"SKILLS"],[1747,1814,"SKILLS"],[1821,1965,"SKILLS"],[2338,3045,"PROJECTS"],[3071,3617,"PROJECTS"],[3702,3733,"CERTIFICATE"],[3739,3774,"CERTIFICATE"]]}]]}
