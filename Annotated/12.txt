Carefully selected manufacturing methods, fabrication and product designs.Identified\r\ndesign, process and equipment options to satisfy client needs, minimize costs and limit potential operational\r\nproblems. Developed, coordinated, and monitored all aspects of production including selection of \r\nmanufacturing methods, fabrication, and operation of product designs.\r\n\r\nThermal and Structural Analysis of Friction Welded Dissimilar Material\r\n\r\nIn this work, the relation between the response Tensile Strength and the input parameters were \r\nstudied for the weld between Medium Carbon Steel and Stainless Steel. It was observed that the\r\nmaximum strength value was obtained during optimum input parameter setting, In this relation \r\nthere are different Mechanical Testings are carried out such as Tensile Test, Impact and Izod \r\nTest, Hardness Test, Bending Test, Microstructure Analysis which results give Higher Integrity\r\nof Welded joints and the breakdown of metals carried on outside portion of the Welded Zone\r\n\r\nJUBAIRREHAMAN\r\n46/66 Kadharpettai, Attur, India \r\njubairrehman@gmail.com \r\nMobile : +919025321582\r\n\r\nACADEMIC DETAILS\r\n\r\nDegree/Course\r\n\r\nB.E Mechanical \r\nDiploma in \r\n\r\nMechanical \r\nHigh School\r\n\r\nWORK EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nRole\r\n•\r\n\r\nPROJECT DETAILS\r\nTitle\r\n:\r\nDescription   :\r\n\r\nDuration       :     Six Months\r\n\r\nRole\r\nTeam Size     :     4\r\n\r\n:    Team Lead\r\n\r\nAREA OF SPECIALIZATION\r\n\r\n• Oil and Gas (Operations and Maintenance, Mechanical Static and Rotating Equipment's)\r\n• Mechanical Site Engineering (HVAC, MEP)\r\n•\r\n\r\nProduction and Manufacturing (Design, Shop floor Machining Operations, Quality Control, Assembly,\r\nInspection, Calibration  Material handlings, Documentation, Dispatch)\r\n\r\n• Management (Planning, Organising, Controlling, QMS, QC Tools, Six Sigma, ISO, Agile Manufacturing)\r\n\r\nSKILLS\r\n\r\n• Microsoft Office Word, Excel, Powerpoint\r\n• Maintenance Strategies (RCA, RCM, CMMS, SAP Condition Monitoring)\r\n• Design Tools and Softwares Autocad, Solidworks and Ansys\r\n• Good oral and written communication skills, Strong Leadership and Interpersonal Skills\r\nSTRENGTH\r\n\r\n• Ability to rapidly build relationships and set up trust\r\n• Ability to cope up with different situations\r\n• Confident and determined\r\n\r\nDECLARATION\r\nI hereby declare that the above mentioned details are true to the best of my knowledge.\r\n\r\n(JUBAIRREHAMAN)\r\n\r\n\fBIO DATA\r\n\r\nName                             : JUBAIRREHAMAN\r\n\r\nFather’s Name              : KALLELREHAMAN\r\n\r\nFather’s Occupation    : DRIVER\r\n\r\nD.O.B                             : 17.07.1995\r\n\r\nGender                           : MALE\r\n\r\nReligion                          : MUSLIM\r\n\r\nLanguages Known        : ENGLISH, HINDI, TAMIL, URDU\r\n\r\nPassport Number          : Z3968327\r\nValidity                          : 05-01-2017 to 04-01-2027\r\nPlace of Issue                 : COIMBATORE\r\n\r\nSkype Id                         : jubair.rehman\r\nFacebook                        : www.fb.com/Jubairrehaman\r\n\r\nContact No                     : +919025321582, +918778656837\r\nEmail                              : jubairrehman@gmail.com\r\n\r\nDesired Salary               : 1200 USD (Excluding all benefits)\r\nMinimum/ Month\r\n\r\nWilling to Relocate        : YES\r\n\r\n\f",{"entities":[[200,231,"INSTITUTION"],[293,320,"INSTITUTION"],[324,354,"INSTITUTION"],[402,422,"ORGANISATION"],[439,458,"ROLE"],[473,492,"DURATION"],[1630,1643,"PERSON"],[1651,1677,"LOCATION"],[1680,1702,"EMAIL"],[1714,1727,"CONTACT"],[1768,1792,"EDUCATION"],[1800,1824,"INSTITUTION"],[2438,2478,"SKILLS"],[2482,2547,"SKILLS"],[2551,2607,"SKILLS"]]}]]}
