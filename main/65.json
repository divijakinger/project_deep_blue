Present  design  analyzed  on  JMAG/ANSYS \r\nMaxwell  to  find  out  their  limitations,  Based  on  that  find  out  simulation  results  &  new  concepts  for \r\ncontact  system  of the MCCB  is  generate.  Project  objective  is  to  enhance  repulsion  threshold  current \r\n(Irp)  of  contact  system  of  250  A  frame  MCCB.  Electromagnetic  repulsion  forces  generated  between \r\nmoving  &  fixed  contacts  are  of  repulsive  nature  due  to  opposite  direction  of  current  path.  The \r\nmechanical force offered by MCCB mechanism opposes these Electromagnetic repulsion forces. In this \r\nproject contact pressure (CP) offered by contact springs will be a constant. \r\n\r\n  Duration: 1 year (July 2014-April 2015) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  Project Title : Generator Protection & Testing of Relays. \r\n  Company: Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd, Thermal Power Station, Gandhinagar. \r\n\r\n  Objective  :  The  objective  of  this  project  is  to  understand  all  about  generator  protection  schemes  & \r\ntheir settings, testing of some protection relay using micro-controller. To protect the generator against \r\nthe  over  current,  differential  and  turbine  to  boiler  trip  with  help  of  instantaneous  micro-controller \r\nbased  relay,  one  can  practically  implement  this  program.  Programming  is  done  in  Code  Vision  AVR \r\nsoftware  and  simulated  in  Proteus  software.  Result  of  this  simulation  is  implemented  in  hardware. \r\nHardware results are same as software result. These programs can be used as reference in power plant \r\nindustries. \r\n\r\n  Duration: 1 year.
