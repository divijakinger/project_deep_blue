# Resume Parser

Flow of this Project -

main.py will be the main file ==> it will cater to all the imports and all the other files.

parse.py => parsing all the files with different file formats => will return text which will then be sent to main.py

extracting all the other fields will be done in the respective file with the name => extract_{field_name}.py ==> which will return all the extracted information to main.py

synopsis.py ==> will take all the extracted information to return a synopsis to main.py
