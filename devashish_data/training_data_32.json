Pelton turbine is most efficient at this \r\ncondition. Thus, more power power can be extracted from a water source with high \r\npressure and low flow than from a source with low pressure and high flow, even \r\nwhen the two flows theoretically contain the same power. Pelton wheels are made in\r\nall sizes.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING\r\n\r\n1.
