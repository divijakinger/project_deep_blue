Work Experience

Marketing Manager
Simpson ACE Hardware & Sporting Goods - Sumter, SC
August 2010 to Present

Increased customer reach for both every-day advertising and key events by over
4000% by implementing a new digital marketing strategy by transitioning the company marketing mix
from relying primarily on newspaper to digital marketing media.
• Facilitates the creation, production, and implementation of all forms of marketing mediums for Simpson
ACE Hardware and Sports. These forms include, but are not limited to social media (Facebook, Instagram
and Tik-
Tok:  posts,  live  and  recorded  video  formats),  e-commerce,  billboards,  circulars,  newsletters,  e-mails,
newspaper, radio, and television while being sure to keep up with the latest marketing industry trends,
changes and innovations to implement into the overall company marketing mix.
• Grew and lead the marketing department from 3 individuals to 16 individuals across 4 locations, while
overseeing an annual budget of over $200,000 spread across print/digital collateral, email promotions,
branding initiatives, partnerships, paid media, and CMS.
•  Analyzes  and  maintains  an  annual  marketing  budget,  suggesting  edits  in  increases/decreases
throughout the year by developing analytical reports of the performance of sales in conjunction with the
promotion advertised.
These  KPI  and  metrics  reports  are  compared  against  campaign  goals,  then  presented  in  weekly  and
monthly overview meetings to determine the direction of the marketing mix for the upcoming months and
year. By doing this I was able to slash marketing costs by over 50% by decreasing the budget allocated
to low reaching newspaper advertising, and increasing the budget allocated to high volume reach digital
and social media platforms, which reached more unique customers saving $50,000 annually.
• Spearheads all creation and promotion of in store and virtual events, with some attracting over 1,000
unique in store customers in a 4-hour window.
Through use of creative marketing and retargeting one key event in particular increased traffic by 76%.
• Built, launched, and managed the official Simpson Hardware and Sporting
Goods e-commerce website in May of 2021. Using SEO, SEM and Social
Media Marketing tactics I was able to attract over 85,000 visitors, generating over $60,000 in additional
sales and garnering an 0.84% conversion rate.
